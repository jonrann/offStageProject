# offStageProject

eCommerce App used to allow Offstage, a dance studio company, manage open classes where choreographers can host classes and students can enroll in them. 

The purpose is to create a user-friendly web application for students to purchase and enroll into a class of their choosing by creating an account to manage personal and payment information. This allows the studio to keep track of who is enrolled, manage payments, and create a smooth experience of taking a dance class at the studio.
